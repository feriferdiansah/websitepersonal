      <P>Looking for Pronoun References and Specific Information is a skill in reading or understanding a text that
        involves identifying pronouns in the text and looking for specific information to which the pronouns refer. When
        we read a text, the author often uses pronouns such as "he," "she," "they," or "it" to refer to people, things,
        or concepts that have been mentioned earlier in the text.</P>
      <li>MEETING 9</li>
      <P>Transition questions are a type of question used to move from one topic or idea to another in a conversation or
        discussion. Transition questions are commonly used when switching from one subtopic to another or when shifting
        the focus or direction of a conversation.</P>
      <li>MEETING 10</li>
      <P>Implied detail questions are questions that seek specific information that is not explicitly stated in the
        given context but can be inferred or deduced based on the information provided.Implied detail questions help
        uncover additional information that may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the given context.
